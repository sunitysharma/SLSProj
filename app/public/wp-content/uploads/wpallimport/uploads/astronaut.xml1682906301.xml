He had been scheduled to fly in autumn 2009, but due to the world financial crisis, this fell through. Aimakhanov remained in Russia, becoming a Russian citizen, making Aimbetov the sole Kazakhstani cosmonaut. &#13;

In June 2015, he was selected to fly on the Soyuz TMA-18M mission in place of singer Sarah Brightman who had withdrawn in May 2015, and her backup, Satoshi Takamatsu, who had also withdrawn. The mission was projected to launch to the International Space Station on 1 September 2015.[4] Aimbetov becomes the third Kazakh-born cosmonaut to fly since Kazakhstan's independence in 1991, and the first to fly under the Kazakh flag, and as part of KazCosmos.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidyn_Aimbetov</wiki><agency><id>182</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/182/?format=json</url><name>National Space Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan</name><featured/><type>Government</type><country_code>KAZ</country_code><abbrev>KazCosmos</abbrev><description>The National Space Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, or KazCosmos, was founded in 2007.

He has been on two spaceflights; the first was the Space Shuttle mission STS-118 to the International Space Station, in August 2007. Drew's second spaceflight took place in March 2011 on STS-133, another mission to the International Space Station. STS-133 was Space Shuttle Discovery's final mission. Drew took part in two spacewalks while docked to the station. Drew was the final African-American to fly on board a Space Shuttle, as the final two Space Shuttle missions, STS-134 and STS-135, had no African-American crew members. He also is currently the latest African-American Astronaut to fly in space.&#13;
&#13;
Drew was selected to be an astronaut in NASA's Astronaut Group 18 in July 2000. Following his rookie spaceflight, Drew spent almost a year at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonauts Training Center in Star City, Russia, overseeing NASA's training operations there as Director of Operations.&#13;
&#13;
On February 28, 2011, Drew became the 200th person to walk in space, when he conducted the first spacewalk of the STS-133 mission with fellow astronaut Steve Bowen.</bio><twitter>https://twitter.com/alvindrew</twitter><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Drew</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

Williams Jr. was an American naval aviator, test pilot, mechanical engineer, major in the United States Marine Corps, and NASA astronaut, who was killed in a plane crash; he had never been to space. The crash was caused by a mechanical failure in a NASA T-38 jet trainer, which he was piloting to visit his parents in Mobile, Alabama. The failure caused the flight controls to stop responding, and although he activated the ejection seat, it did not save him. He was the fourth astronaut from NASA's Astronaut Group 3 to have died, the first two (Charles Bassett and Theodore Freeman) having been killed in separate T-38 flights, and the third (Roger B. Chaffee) in the Apollo 1 fire earlier that year. The aircraft crashed in Florida near Tallahassee within an hour of departing Patrick AFB.&#13;
&#13;
Although he was never on a spaceflight, he served as backup pilot for the mission Gemini 10, which took place in July 1966. Following this mission, he was selected to be the Lunar Module pilot for an Apollo mission to the Moon commanded by Pete Conrad. Following Williams' death, Alan Bean became Lunar Module pilot for Conrad's mission, which ended up being Apollo 12, the second lunar landing.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_Williams</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

This 196-day mission set a new record for the longest duration spaceflight for an American astronaut, a record simultaneously set with his crew mate Carl Walz.

He graduated from the University of Utah with an undergraduate degree in physics in 1953. Following his military service obligation, he earned a Ph.D. in high-energy nuclear physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964.&#13;
&#13;
Lind was a naval aviator and attained the rank of Commander in the United States Naval Reserve. He had active duty in San Diego and aboard the carrier USS Hancock.&#13;

After completing his doctorate, Lind worked at NASA's Goddard Research Center from 1964 to 1966. During this period, he applied for the third group of astronauts but did not have enough flight hours. He applied for the fourth group, but was denied for being too old. The age restriction was raised for the fifth group, and he was selected with the Original Nineteen in 1966. Lind helped to develop the Apollo 11 EVA activities, and served as CAPCOM for the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. He was then assigned as backup Pilot for Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 and nearly flew on the proposed Skylab Rescue mission.&#13;
&#13;
Lind was the Payload Commander on his only flight, STS-51-B, launched April 29, 1985. He designed an experiment to capture the Earth's aurora. The payload experiments consisted primarily of microgravity research and atmospheric measurement. The Orbiter Challenger completed 110 orbits before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_L._Lind</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

&#13;
Before becoming a NASA astronaut, Gibson graduated from the University of Rochester and the California Institute of Technology. He became a research assistant in jet propulsion while completing his studies and eventually became a research scientist for Philco Corporation until joining NASA.&#13;
&#13;
Gibson was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1965 as part of Astronaut Group 4, the first group of scientist-astronauts. He served on the support crew of Apollo 12 before moving on to work on the development of the Skylab space station. In 1973–74, Gibson made his first and only flight into space as science pilot aboard Skylab 4, the third and final manned flight to Skylab. He, along with Commander Gerald Carr and Pilot William Pogue, spent just over 84 days in space. Gibson resigned from NASA in December 1974, but returned in 1977 to preside over the selection of scientist-astronaut candidates. Gibson retired from NASA for the last time in October 1982.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Gibson</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

&#13;
Ivanov, along with Soviet cosmonaut Nikolai Rukavishnikov, was launched into space as part of the Soyuz 33 mission from Baikonur Cosmodrome on April 10, 1979, at 17:34 (GMT). The scientific program for the flight was prepared entirely by Bulgarian scientists, along with some of the equipment.&#13;
&#13;
Though take-off was smooth, the mission was a disaster, with severe damage of the engine preventing docking in orbit to Salyut 6 orbital station as it was initially planned. A premature return to Earth became the only possible decision for Ivanov and Rukavishnikov. Due to some additional technical problems landing was difficult to endure-more than 9Gs. When Soyuz 33 finally landed, it was 320 kilometres (200 mi) southeast of Dzhezkazgan. It completed 31 orbits, and was in space for 1 day, 23 hours, and 1 minute. The flight remains the only example for manual landing and is thus quoted in every astronautic textbook.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi_Ivanov_(cosmonaut)</wiki><agency><id>63</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json</url><name>Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>RUS</country_code><abbrev>RFSA</abbrev><description>The Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities, commonly known as Roscosmos, is the governmental body responsible for the space science program of the Russian Federation and general aerospace research.

Engle test-flew the joint NASA-Air Force X-15 rocket airplane. During the course of testing, Engle earned his USAF Astronaut Wings, a Distinguished Flying Cross and other awards. Engle was selected by NASA in 1966 for the Apollo program, and was originally scheduled to land on the Moon as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 17, but was bumped when later flights were cancelled, so that geologist-astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt could fly.&#13;
&#13;
He subsequently became one of the first astronauts in the Space Shuttle program, having flight tested the Space Shuttle Enterprise in 1977.

He became the ninth person to walk on the Moon as Commander of the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. Young enjoyed the longest career of any astronaut, becoming the first person to fly six space missions (with seven launches, counting his lunar liftoff) over the course of 42 years of active NASA service. He is the only person to have piloted, and been commander of, four different classes of spacecraft: Gemini, the Apollo Command/Service Module, the Apollo Lunar Module, and the Space Shuttle.&#13;
&#13;
In 1965, Young flew on the first manned Gemini mission, and commanded another Gemini mission the next year. In 1969 during Apollo 10, he became the first person to fly solo around the Moon. He drove the Lunar Roving Vehicle on the Moon's surface during Apollo 16, and is one of only three people to have flown to the Moon twice. He also commanded two Space Shuttle flights, including its first launch in 1981, and served as Chief of the Astronaut Office from 1974 to 1987. Young retired from NASA in 2004.

&#13;
Recognised while still a child for her "intellectual brilliance",[1] Resnik went on to work for RCA as an engineer on NASA missile and radar projects, was a senior systems engineer for Xerox Corporation, and published research on special purpose integrated circuitry, before she was recruited by NASA to the astronaut program as a mission specialist at age 28. While training on the astronaut program, she developed software and operating procedures for NASA missions.[2] She was also a pilot and made research contributions to biomedical engineering, as a research fellow of biomedical engineering at the National Institutes of Health.&#13;
&#13;
Initially planning to be a concert pianist, Resnik had turned down a place at the Juilliard School of Music, choosing instead to study mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University after being one of only 16 girls in the United States to have attained 100% scores in her SAT exams at the time. She went on to graduate from Carnegie Institute of Technology in electrical engineering, before graduating with a Ph.D. magna cum laude in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland.&#13;
&#13;
Resnik was the second American woman in space, and the fourth woman in space worldwide, logging 145 hours in orbit. She was also the first Jewish American in space, and the first Jewish woman of any nationality in space. The IEEE Judith Resnik Award for space engineering is named in her honor.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Resnik</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

Born in Washington, D.C., she was selected by NASA in 1996 and qualified as a mission specialist in robotics. Nowak flew aboard Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-121 mission in July 2006, where she was responsible for operating the robotic arms of the shuttle and the International Space Station.&#13;
&#13;
On February 5, 2007, she was arrested in Orlando, Florida, and subsequently charged with the attempted kidnapping of U.S. Air Force Captain Colleen Shipman, who was romantically involved with astronaut William Oefelein. Nowak was released on bail, and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, which included attempted kidnapping, burglary with assault, and battery. Her assignment to the space agency as an astronaut was terminated by NASA effective March 8, 2007. On November 10, 2009, Nowak agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to charges of felony burglary of a car and misdemeanor battery.&#13;
&#13;
Nowak remained a Navy captain until August 2010, when a naval board of inquiry, composed of three admirals, voted unanimously to reduce Nowak in rank to commander and to discharge her from the Navy under other than honorable conditions.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Nowak</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

He is the husband of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, and is an author, political activist, and aerospace executive and consultant.&#13;
&#13;
A naval aviator, Kelly flew combat missions during the Gulf War. He was selected to become a NASA Space Shuttle pilot in 1996 and flew his first mission in 2001 as pilot of STS-108. He piloted STS-121 in 2006 and commanded STS-124 in 2008 and STS-134 in 2011. STS-134 was his final mission and the final mission of Space Shuttle Endeavour.&#13;
&#13;
His wife was the target of an attempted assassination in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 2011. After the shooting, in which six people were killed, both Kelly and Giffords were thrust into the media spotlight. His wife's shooting led to a broad national conversation ranging from the duties of a husband to what is acceptable civil discourse.&#13;

Kelly's identical twin brother, Scott Kelly, is also an astronaut. The Kelly brothers are the only known siblings to have both traveled in space. In 2015, Scott Kelly began a mission spending a year in space on the International Space Station. He returned to Earth on March 1, 2016, after 340 days in space. During and after Scott's year-long mission, the brothers were studied to find physical differences caused by living in space versus a baseline on Earth.</bio><twitter>https://twitter.com/ShuttleCDRKelly</twitter><instagram>https://www.instagram.com/shuttlecdrkelly/</instagram><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

He was selected as a backup flight engineer for Soyuz MS-02. He was made a prime crew member of Soyuz MS-04 but, due to Russian budget cuts, the crews were changed and Tikhonov was then slated to make his first spaceflight on the Soyuz MS-10 spacecraft. He was again removed from the manifest due to delays in launching the Russian Nauka module. He was scheduled to fly into space as commander of the Soyuz MS-15 mission, although he was removed for a third time following the aborted launch of Soyuz MS-10, and the subsequent crew changes that followed. He was then scheduled to finally make his first flight onboard Soyuz MS-16 in 2020. However he reportedly got an eye injury a month before the launch, was replaced on the flight, and subsequently left the cosmonaut corps due to health issues.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Tikhonov_(cosmonaut)</wiki><agency><id>63</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json</url><name>Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>RUS</country_code><abbrev>RFSA</abbrev><description>The Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities, commonly known as Roscosmos, is the governmental body responsible for the space science program of the Russian Federation and general aerospace research.

Cenker worked for 18 years at RCA Astro-Electronics, and its successor company GE Astro Space, on a variety of spacecraft projects. He spent most of his career working on commercial communications satellites, including the Satcom, Spacenet and GStar programs.&#13;
&#13;
In January 1986, Cenker was a crew member on the twenty-fourth mission of NASA's Space Shuttle program, the seventh flight of Space Shuttle Columbia, designated as mission STS-61-C. Cenker served as a Payload Specialist, representing RCA Astro-Electronics. This mission was the final flight before the Challenger disaster, which caused the Space Shuttle program to be suspended until 1988, and impacted NASA's Payload Specialist program for even longer. As a result, Cenker's mission was called "The End of Innocence" for the Shuttle program. Following the completion of his Shuttle mission, Cenker returned to work in the commercial aerospace field. Since his flight, he has made numerous public appearances representing NASA and the Shuttle program, in the United States, as well as internationally.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Cenker</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

&#13;
Selected in 1963 for NASA's third astronaut group, he is best known as the Lunar Module Pilot on the 1969 Apollo 9 mission, the first manned flight test of the Lunar Module, on which he performed the first in-space test of the Portable Life Support System used by the Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon. As backup Commander of the first manned Skylab mission in 1973, he was responsible for developing the hardware and procedures used by the first crew to perform critical in-flight repairs of the Skylab station. After Skylab, he served for a time as Director of User Affairs in NASA's Office of Applications.&#13;
&#13;
Schweickart left NASA in 1977 to serve for two years as California Governor Jerry Brown's assistant for science and technology, then was appointed by Brown to California's Energy Commission for five and a half years, serving as chairman for three.&#13;
&#13;
In 1984–85 he co-founded the Association of Space Explorers and later in 2002 co-founded the B612 Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to defending Earth from asteroid impacts, along with fellow former astronaut Ed Lu and two planetary scientists. He served for a period as its chair before becoming its chair emeritus.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Schweickart</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

A veteran of four space flights, Kelly commanded the International Space Station (ISS) on Expeditions 26, 45, and 46.&#13;
&#13;
Kelly's first spaceflight was as pilot of Space Shuttle Discovery, during STS-103 in December 1999. This was the third servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, and lasted for just under eight days. Kelly's second spaceflight was as mission commander of STS-118, a 12-day Space Shuttle mission to the International Space Station in August 2007. Kelly's third spaceflight was as commander of Expedition 26 on the ISS. He arrived 9 October 2010, on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft, during Expedition 25, and served as a flight engineer until it ended. He took over command of the station on 25 November 2010, at the start of Expedition 26 which began officially when the spacecraft Soyuz TMA-19 undocked, carrying the previous commander of the station, Douglas H. Wheelock. Expedition 26 ended on 16 March 2011 with the departure of Soyuz TMA-01M. This was Kelly's first long-duration spaceflight.&#13;
&#13;
In November 2012, Kelly was selected, along with Mikhail Korniyenko, for a year-long mission to the International Space Station. Their year in space commenced 27 March 2015 with the start of Expedition 43, continued through the entirety of Expeditions 44, and 45, both of which Kelly commanded. He passed command to Timothy Kopra on 29 February 2016, when the ISS 11-month mission ended. He returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TMA-18M on 1 March 2016.</bio><twitter>https://twitter.com/StationCDRKelly</twitter><instagram>https://www.instagram.com/stationcdrkelly/</instagram><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Kelly_(astronaut)</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

In March 2011, Bowen completed his third spaceflight as a Mission Specialist on STS-133, which was Space Shuttle Discovery's final planned flight. Having flown on both STS-132 and STS-133, Bowen became the first and only astronaut to fly on consecutive shuttle missions. Originally Tim Kopra was scheduled to fly on STS-133, but Kopra had a bicycle injury shortly before the mission, and so he was replaced by Bowen.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Bowen_(astronaut)</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

After a normal re-entry, the capsule was opened and the crew was found dead. It was discovered that a valve had opened just prior to leaving orbit that had allowed the capsule's atmosphere to vent away into space, suffocating the crew.

Quote: "When we look into the sky it seems to us to be endless. We breathe without thinking about it, as is natural... and then you sit aboard a spacecraft, you tear away from Earth, and within ten minutes you have been carried straight through the layer of air, and beyond there is nothing! The 'boundless' blue sky, the ocean which gives us breath and protects us from endless black and death, is but an infinitesimally thin film. How dangerous it is to threaten even the smallest part of this gossamer covering, this conserver of life."</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Shatalov</wiki><agency><id>63</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json</url><name>Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>RUS</country_code><abbrev>RFSA</abbrev><description>The Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities, commonly known as Roscosmos, is the governmental body responsible for the space science program of the Russian Federation and general aerospace research.

Vasyutin was assigned to the TKS program for a new generation of manned military spacecraft that would be docked to the existing Salyut space stations.&#13;
&#13;
He flew as the Commander on Soyuz T-14 to the Salyut 7 space station, for part of the long-duration mission Salyut 7 EO-4. He spent 64 days 21 hours 52 minutes in space. The TKS module was already docked to the Salyut and Vasyutin was due to lead an extended programme of military space experiments. However Vasyutin fell ill soon after arriving at the station and was unable to perform his duties. Although he was originally scheduled to have a six-month stay aboard Salyut 7, his illness forced the crew to make an emergency return to Earth after only two months. His illness is said to have been caused by a prostate infection, which had manifested itself as inflammation and a fever.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vasyutin</wiki><agency><id>63</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json</url><name>Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>RUS</country_code><abbrev>RFSA</abbrev><description>The Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities, commonly known as Roscosmos, is the governmental body responsible for the space science program of the Russian Federation and general aerospace research.

The second mission terminated fatally.&#13;
&#13;
Volkov, on his second space mission in 1971, was assigned to Soyuz 11. The three cosmonauts on this flight spent 23 days on Salyut 1, the world's first space station. After three relatively placid weeks in orbit, however, Soyuz 11 became the second Soviet space flight to terminate fatally, after Soyuz 1.&#13;
&#13;
After a normal re-entry, the Soyuz 11 capsule was opened and the corpses of the three crew members were found inside. It was discovered that a valve had opened just prior to leaving orbit that had allowed the capsule's atmosphere to vent away into space, causing Volkov and his two flight companions to suffer fatal hypoxia as their cabin descended toward the earth's atmosphere.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladislav_Volkov</wiki><agency><id>63</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json</url><name>Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>RUS</country_code><abbrev>RFSA</abbrev><description>The Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities, commonly known as Roscosmos, is the governmental body responsible for the space science program of the Russian Federation and general aerospace research.

&#13;
Born and educated in Oklahoma, Pogue graduated from college and enlisted in the United States Air Force, in which he served for 24 years. He flew combat during the Korean War, and with the elite USAF Thunderbirds. He served as a flight instructor and mathematics professor, and was a versatile test pilot, including two years in an exchange with the RAF (UK).&#13;
&#13;
Colonel Pogue was an Air Force instructor when accepted into NASA in 1966. His astronaut career included one orbital mission, as pilot of the last crew of Skylab. The crew set a duration record (84 days) that was unbroken in NASA for over 20 years, and in orbit they conducted dozens of research experiments. The mission was also noted for a dispute with ground control over schedule management that news media named “The Skylab Mutiny”.&#13;
&#13;
Pogue retired from both the USAF and NASA a few months after he returned from Skylab. Over the next 30 plus years he taught, lectured, consulted, and wrote about aviation and aeronatics, in the US and abroad. He died in 2014, age 84, survived by three children, four stepsons, and his third wife.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_R._Pogue</wiki><agency><id>44</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/44/?format=json</url><name>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>USA</country_code><abbrev>NASA</abbrev><description>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research.

Yi was one of the two finalists chosen on December 25, 2006 through the Korean Astronaut Program. On September 5, 2007, the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology chose Ko San, over Yi So-yeon, following performance and other tests during their training in Russia.&#13;
&#13;
On March 7, 2008, she was selected to train with the primary crew, and on March 10 the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology announced that Yi would replace Ko. This was after the Russian Federal Space Agency asked for a replacement, because Ko violated regulations several times at a Russian training center by removing sensitive reading materials and mailing one back to Korea. On April 8, 2008, Yi was launched into space on board Soyuz TMA-12 with two Russian cosmonauts. South Korea is reported to have paid Russia $20 million for Yi's space flight. She is the third woman, after Helen Sharman of the United Kingdom and Anousheh Ansari an Iranian American, to be the first national from their country in space.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_So-yeon</wiki><agency><id>261</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/261/?format=json</url><name>Korean Astronaut Program</name><featured/><type>Government</type><country_code>KOR</country_code><abbrev>KAP</abbrev><description>The Korean Astronaut Program was an initiative by the South Korean government to send the first Korean into space via the Russian space program.

&#13;
Artyukhin graduated from the Soviet Air Force Institute with a doctorate in engineering, specializing in military communication systems. He was selected for the space programme in 1963 and would have flown on the Voskhod 3 mission had it not been canceled. He made his single flight on Soyuz 14 in 1974, where his area of expertise was presumably put to good use.&#13;
&#13;
He left the space programme in 1982 and held various positions in space-related fields. Most notably, he was involved in the development of the Soviet space shuttle Buran and in cosmonaut training.</bio><twitter/><instagram/><wiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yury_Artyukhin</wiki><agency><id>63</id><url>https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/63/?format=json</url><name>Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)</name><featured>1</featured><type>Government</type><country_code>RUS</country_code><abbrev>RFSA</abbrev><description>The Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities, commonly known as Roscosmos, is the governmental body responsible for the space science program of the Russian Federation and general aerospace research.

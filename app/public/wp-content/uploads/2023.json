The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.","orbit":"Low Earth

His first mission, STS-126, took place in November 2008, and his second was STS-132 in May 2010.\r\n\r\nIn March 2011, Bowen completed his third spaceflight as a Mission Specialist on STS-133, which was Space Shuttle Discovery's final planned flight. Having flown on both STS-132 and STS-133, Bowen became the first and only astronaut to fly on consecutive shuttle missions. Originally Tim Kopra was scheduled to fly on STS-133, but Kopra had a bicycle injury shortly before the mission, and so he was replaced by Bowen.","profile_image":"https:\/\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/media\/astronaut_images\/stephen_bowen_image_20220911034047.jpeg","wiki":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stephen_Bowen_(astronaut)","last_flight":"2023-03-02T05:34:14Z","first_flight":"2008-11-15T00:55:00Z"}},{"id":3608,"role":{"id":2,"role":"Pilot","priority":2},"astronaut":{"id":145,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/astronaut\/145\/?format=json","name":"Warren Hoburg","type":{"id":2,"name":"Government"},"in_space":true,"time_in_space":"P135DT20H23M16S","status":{"id":1,"name":"Active"},"agency":{"id":44,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/agencies\/44\/?format=json","name":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","type":"Government"},"date_of_birth":"1985-09-16","date_of_death":null,"nationality":"American","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Astro_Woody","instagram":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/whoburg","bio":"Warren Woodrow \"Woody\" Hoburg is an American engineer and NASA astronaut of the class of 2017.","profile_image":"https:\/\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/media\/astronaut_images\/warren2520hoburg_image_20181129210410.jpg","wiki":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Warren_Hoburg","last_flight":"2023-03-02T05:34:14Z","first_flight":"2023-03-02T05:34:14Z"}},{"id":3694,"role":{"id":7,"role":"Mission Specialist","priority":4},"astronaut":{"id":732,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/astronaut\/732\/?format=json","name":"Andrei Fedyaev","type":{"id":2,"name":"Government"},"in_space":true,"time_in_space":"P135DT20H31M26S","status":{"id":1,"name":"Active"},"agency":{"id":63,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/agencies\/63\/?format=json","name":"Russian Federal Space Agency (ROSCOSMOS)","type":"Government"},"date_of_birth":"1981-02-26","date_of_death":null,"nationality":"Russian","twitter":null,"instagram":null,"bio":"Andrei Valerievich Fedyaev (\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u044f\u0435\u0432) is a Russian cosmonaut.

For example, an H3-24L has two engines, four solid rocket boosters, and a long fairing, whereas an H3-30S has three engines, no solid rocket boosters, and a short fairing.","family":"H3","full_name":"H3-22","manufacturer":{"id":98,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/agencies\/98\/?format=json","name":"Mitsubishi Heavy Industries","featured":false,"type":"Commercial","country_code":"JPN","abbrev":"MHI","description":"Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. is a Japanese multinational engineering, electrical equipment and electronics company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan.

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

They also operate from SLC-4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, usually for polar launches. Another launch site is being developed at Boca Chica, Texas.","administrator":"CEO: Elon Musk","founding_year":"2002","launchers":"Falcon | Starship","spacecraft":"Dragon","launch_library_url":"https:\/\/launchlibrary.net\/1.4\/agency\/121","total_launch_count":261,"consecutive_successful_launches":22,"successful_launches":251,"failed_launches":10,"pending_launches":115,"consecutive_successful_landings":130,"successful_landings":212,"failed_landings":19,"attempted_landings":231,"info_url":"http:\/\/www.spacex.com\/","wiki_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/SpaceX","logo_url":"https:\/\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/media\/logo\/spacex_logo_20220826094919.png","image_url":"https:\/\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/media\/agency_images\/spacex_image_20190207032501.jpeg","nation_url":"https:\/\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/media\/agency_nation\/spacex_nation_20230531064544.jpg"},"program":[{"id":5,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/program\/5\/?format=json","name":"Commercial Crew Program","description":"The Commercial Crew Program (CCP) is a human spaceflight program operated by NASA, in association with American aerospace manufacturers Boeing and SpaceX.

Its first component was launched into orbit in 1998, with the first long-term residents arriving in November 2000. It has been inhabited continuously since that date. The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.","orbit":"Low Earth Orbit","image_url":"https:\/\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/media\/spacestation_images\/international2520space2520station_image_20190220215716.jpeg"},"docking":"2023-05-22T13:12:00Z","departure":"2023-05-30T15:05:00Z","docking_location":{"id":30,"name":"Harmony zenith","spacestation":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/spacestation\/4\/?format=json","name":"International Space Station"}}}]}},"mission":{"id":1367,"name":"Axiom Space Mission 2","description":"This is a Crew Dragon flight for a private company Axiom Space.

It is also used as a suborbital testbed (called HASTE) for hypersonics research.","family":"Electron","full_name":"Electron","manufacturer":{"id":147,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/agencies\/147\/?format=json","name":"Rocket Lab","featured":true,"type":"Commercial","country_code":"USA","abbrev":"RL","description":"Rocket Lab is an American aerospace manufacturer with a wholly owned New Zealand subsidiary.

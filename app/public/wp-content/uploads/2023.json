Its first component was launched into orbit in 1998, with the first long-term residents arriving in November 2000. It has been inhabited continuously since that date. The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and American Space Shuttles.","orbit":"Low Earth

The last pressurised module was fitted in 2011, and an experimental inflatable space habitat was added in 2016. The station is expected to operate until 2030. Development and assembly of the station continues, with several new elements scheduled for launch in 2019. The ISS is the largest human-made body in low Earth orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurised habitation modules, structural trusses, solar arrays, radiators, docking ports, experiment bays and robotic arms.

Sturckow is a veteran of four Space Shuttle missions. He flew on STS-88 and STS-105 as a pilot and STS-117 and STS-128 as a commander. All four missions docked with the International Space Station, making Sturckow one of two people to visit the station four times. Sturckow later was assigned to the Johnson Space Center as a CAPCOM. He left NASA in 2013 to become a pilot for Virgin Galactic.","profile_image":"https:\/\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/media\/astronaut_images\/frederick_w._st_image_20210522153643.jpeg","wiki":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frederick_W._Sturckow","last_flight":"2023-04-26T13:47:00Z","first_flight":"1998-12-04T08:35:34Z"}},{"id":4716,"role":{"id":31,"role":"Passenger","priority":7},"astronaut":{"id":761,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/astronaut\/761\/?format=json","name":"Jamila Gilbert","type":{"id":3,"name":"Private"},"in_space":false,"time_in_space":"P0D","status":{"id":1,"name":"Active"},"agency":{"id":1024,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/agencies\/1024\/?format=json","name":"Virgin Galactic","type":"Private"},"date_of_birth":null,"date_of_death":null,"nationality":"American","twitter":null,"instagram":null,"bio":"Virgin Galactic internal communications lead","profile_image":"https:\/\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/media\/astronaut_images\/jamila_gilbert_image_20230508161019.png","wiki":null,"last_flight":null,"first_flight":null}},{"id":4717,"role":{"id":31,"role":"Passenger","priority":7},"astronaut":{"id":762,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/astronaut\/762\/?format=json","name":"Christopher Huie","type":{"id":3,"name":"Private"},"in_space":false,"time_in_space":"P0D","status":{"id":1,"name":"Active"},"agency":{"id":1024,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/agencies\/1024\/?format=json","name":"Virgin Galactic","type":"Private"},"date_of_birth":null,"date_of_death":null,"nationality":"American","twitter":null,"instagram":null,"bio":"Aerospace engineer, senior manager of Virgin Galactic's Flight Sciences Engineering team.","profile_image":"https:\/\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/media\/astronaut_images\/christopher_hui_image_20230508161156.png","wiki":null,"last_flight":null,"first_flight":null}},{"id":4718,"role":{"id":31,"role":"Passenger","priority":7},"astronaut":{"id":763,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/astronaut\/763\/?format=json","name":"Luke Mays","type":{"id":3,"name":"Private"},"in_space":false,"time_in_space":"P0D","status":{"id":1,"name":"Active"},"agency":{"id":1024,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/agencies\/1024\/?format=json","name":"Virgin Galactic","type":"Private"},"date_of_birth":null,"date_of_death":null,"nationality":"American","twitter":null,"instagram":null,"bio":"Former NASA astronaut instructor, now astronaut instructor at Virgin Galactic.","profile_image":"https:\/\/spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com\/media\/astronaut_images\/luke_mays_image_20230508161309.png","wiki":null,"last_flight":null,"first_flight":null}},{"id":4719,"role":{"id":31,"role":"Passenger","priority":7},"astronaut":{"id":680,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/astronaut\/680\/?format=json","name":"Beth Moses","type":{"id":3,"name":"Private"},"in_space":false,"time_in_space":"-PT4H41M30S","status":{"id":1,"name":"Active"},"agency":{"id":1024,"url":"https:\/\/ll.thespacedevs.com\/2.2.0\/agencies\/1024\/?format=json","name":"Virgin Galactic","type":"Private"},"date_of_birth":"1980-05-30","date_of_death":null,"nationality":"American","twitter":null,"instagram":null,"bio":"Beth Moses is Chief Astronaut Instructor and Interiors Program Manager for Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo program, and is a commercial astronaut.
